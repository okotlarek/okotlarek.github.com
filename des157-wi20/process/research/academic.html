            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Sources 1 and 3 speak about how Facebook’s influence causes consequences that it’s inventors did not anticipate. Overall, these two sources communicate that there is a strong relationship between online political discourse/engagement and political participation offline. The theme of source 2 is that North America is broken up into 11 subdivisions that the author calls “nations” within the continent. </p>

            <p>While political advertisements have always been a popular way for candidates to communicate to the public about their platform, source 3 explains that money spent on political advertisements on Facebook in the 2016 election was astronomical. One of the potential consequences of actions like this being taken is the spread of misinformation. Articles and pieces of information that are dramatic or have “clickbait” titles are often the types of things that are spread most rapidly. News articles and other pieces of journalism are usually fact-checked and held to a certain standard of truth. On Facebook, people often read and share posts that are not fact checked, propagating the spread of misinformation. </p>

            <p>Source 1 speaks about how engagement on Facebook has been observed to result in more political engagement offline. This makes sense, as people are often influenced by the actions of those around them. If a Facebook user sees that their friends are engaging in political discourse online, they will be more likely to join in and form a habit of being politically active. However, this study did not conclude that the increased political participation resulted in overall increased political knowledge. I believe this is a problem in itself, as we become less inclined as citizens to take it upon ourselves to investigate our own political sphere. Especially among young people, it is difficult to encourage political participation and an active pursuit of knowledge. Seeing studies like this seem to signify there is hope for our political future if internet activists have influence in the offline world as well.</p>

            <p>Source 2 speaks about the 11 “nations” of North America and what they stand for. It is clear that different regions in the US in particular have different values and customs, but reading about these discrete categories for these regions is eye-opening and thought provoking. If I can include this information in my interaction, it will help users understand where different political values are popular and why. As one of the main goals of my interaction is to inspire empathy, including information that helps users understand conflicting beliefs will be important. In order to have a productive conversation about one’s beliefs in relation to others, we must first understand them all.</p>
