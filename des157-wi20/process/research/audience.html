        <h1>User Research - Personas</h1>
        <p>Because my interaction will differ based on the political knowledge and involvement of the user, I have crafted these general personas on a spectrum of political involvement. In order, they are Politically Withdrawn, Politically Ambivalent, Politically Casual, and Politically Active.</p>
