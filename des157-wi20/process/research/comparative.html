            <h2>Pew Research Political Typology Quiz</h2>

                The Pew Research Center Political Typology Quiz is an interactive web-based experience that takes user information and delivers a "result" at the end. I chose a quiz-type of interaction because it is common for people to want to take quizzes and compare themselves when it comes to political alignment. As I have focused my area of study for this project to how the digital age and interactivity affect political participation/knowledge, I think it is important to look at common and accessible interactive webpages that people may come across while doing political research. A big part of the process is finding out about yourself and your principles, and some people need assistance translating their principles into where they may fall on the political spectrum in order to understand it as a whole. In this case, I think the quiz works well. It takes the information that the user selects and uses that to make a determination about where they fall on the political spectrum. <br>
                
                Each question is separated on its own page to limit the information the user must absorb per screen, which is a wise decision in terms of user experience because the content is usually difficult to digest. The typical audience for this type of interaction would likely be someone who is not very knowledgeable about politics, but eager to know more. I think the quiz interaction is beneficial to the audience because it not only makes users choose between scenarios/beliefs, but prompts them to think about issues they may not have considered before. While it is a relatively linear experience just going from one question to the next, there is logical navigation and satisfying visual effects that make the user interface work very well. There is little to no emotional effect from using this interaction. Pew Research strives to be a non-partisan, objective source for a wide range of topics, so most content a user will find there will be rather matter-of-fact and not attempt to persuade or have an emotional appeal.

            <h2>Political Battle</h2>

                This Political Battle interaction is a quiz that has been made into a game. The user selects which candidate they would choose (or vote for, should they be given the chance) from different countries and in the end, the quiz will tell you where you might lie on the political spectrum. Comparing this to the first example, I think there are flaws with assuming that one candidate or another perfectly embodies the principles of one party so strongly that voting for them is a proper metric from which to measure a user’s political preferences. However, the fact that this quiz is much shorter and visually impactful means that it might engage a casual user more than a highly motivated user. The style of the quiz resembles how boxing opponents are pitted against each other, with interesting effects when the mouse hovers. This is a good quality to have when trying to engage users that may not be interested in politics and need it to be “spiced up” with fun features. The choice in navigation that the user has is mostly limited to the candidate they choose. These are details I will remember when I tackle this subject matter for my final project. <br>

                The emotional appeal of this interaction will be different for each user, depending on where they eventually fall on the political spectrum. If a user selects candidates they like and gets their results, they may feel surprised, disappointed, affirmed, or something else entirely. I think this interaction could be improved by having more of an educational and thought-provoking portion to it as well as the fun and interesting game aspect. If a user would like to take this quiz but doesn’t keep up with international politics, they may not play the game at all because they don’t know who they would vote for. The likely case is that someone who knows who they would vote for in different countries is interested in politics and wouldn’t need a quiz to determine where they stand. There is a disconnect with the target audience.
