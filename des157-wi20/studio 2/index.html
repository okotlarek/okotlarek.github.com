          <h2>Travel Coffee Mug</h2>
          <p>I bring my travel coffee mug with me to class so I can enjoy my morning coffee as I walk to class and as I do my work. It makes my morning much more enjoyable to have this insulated cup with me because my coffee stays warm even hours after I make it.</p>

          <h2>Flash Drive</h2>
          <p>I always carry a flash drive (or two!) with me in my backpack because I use them daily with all the digital files I need to keep track of. I feel secure knowing I have a physical drive to put my files rather than always relying on cloud-based solutions!</p>

          <h2>X-acto Knife</h2>
          <p>I keep an X-acto Knife in my bag because I use it in DES155A (Pattern, Form, and Surface) when we have time in class to work with our form-making materials. Also, as a Design major, you never know when it will come in handy!</p>
